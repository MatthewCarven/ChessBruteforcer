# TODO / roadmap

If you're asking "where are we?", this is the answer. Top to bottom is
roughly the order of work. Tick items off here and log them in
[WORKLOG.md](WORKLOG.md).

## Now: the session plan (5-piece tables and the depth ladder)

Agreed with Matthew 2026-09-27. One session per step, in order. Any step
may take two sessions: if it does, stop at a clean commit and write where it
stands here. The goal is 5-piece tables built **up a ladder**: solve to a
capped depth, then extend. More disk then buys more depth, and nothing
below is redone. That only works if the edges are right, which is what
sessions 2 and 3 are about.

Shared facts for every session:
- Full test suite: ~11 min on Windows (`dotnet test -c Release tests/...`).
  Run it in the background; use `--filter` for the endgame tests while working.
- Regression check: `scripts/measure-tables.sh <cli bin> <empty dir> <log>`
  solves all 36 tables up to 4 pieces (~8 min) and prints each table's time
  and solver memory. Then `cmp` every .cbt against `tables-baseline/`
  (gitignored, Windows copy: the 36 tables from the pre-step-2 solver,
  plus `before.log`, the baseline memory figures).
- Memory is tight: WSL is capped at 7.8 GB, and Windows runs short with the
  Claude app and Cowork VM open. Run one big solve at a time.

### Session 1: finish the solver's memory (step 2)
Branch `solver-memory` holds the work, uncommitted to main. Done there:
`BitSet` for `_hasDrawingExit` / `_final` (1 bit each, was 1 byte);
queue entries `uint` (was `long`), en passant nodes marked by the top bit;
`SolverMemory` (arrays, queues, entries), printed by `solve`; 5-piece guard
lifted for pawnless tables, `Tablebase.MaxPieces` = 5.
- [ ] **Open bug first.** `solve KQRPvK` should refuse at once
      (NotSupportedException: five pieces with pawns) but hung for 60 s+
      on 2026-09-27; so did the two new tests (`--filter` on
      `TooBigToSolve|ReportsItsSolverMemory`, testhost at 1.4 GB). The full
      suite reported 1 failure, in `TablesTooBigToSolveAreRefusedBeforeAnyWork`.
      Find out which row, and why anything is being solved or allocated
      before the guard. Suspects: `Material.Parse` / `IsCanonical` for these
      strings, or the CLI path around `Tablebase.Get`.
- [ ] Full suite green. Regression: 36 of 36 byte-identical to `tables-baseline`.
- [ ] Before/after table for Matthew, per table, from the two logs
      (baseline: KQvKR 52.9 MB = 25.3 arrays + 27.7 queues; KRPvK 204.3 MB
      = 98.8 + 105.6; all 36 in 479 s). Expected after: arrays 7 -> 5.25
      bytes a slot, queues halved, so about 0.6x overall. Note any slowdown
      from the bit twiddling.
- [ ] Project to 5 pieces from the measured bytes per slot (242 M slots).
      Expected: ~1.3 GB arrays + ~1 GB queues. The list-doubling copy spikes
      on the largest bucket may add a few hundred MB. If that's too close,
      the fallback is to drop the queues and rescan the table once per ply
- [ ] WORKLOG, README (`solve` output), merge `solver-memory` into main, commit.
      Tell Matthew it needs pushing.

### Session 2: cap and resume (ladder parts a and b)
- [ ] A stored value for **"deeper than N"**, distinct from draw. Today
      `Unknown` (short.MaxValue) turns into 0 = draw at the end of `Run`.
      A capped table must keep "not settled within N" apart from a proven
      draw. `Outcome` gets a matching kind, and `probe` / `line` /
      `RankMoves` / statistics say so.
- [ ] `solve <material> --cap N`: stop after ply N. File header records the
      cap (CBT3; CBT2 and CBT1 still load as complete). Wins already queued
      at ply N+1 are exact (every shorter loss is final by then); decide
      whether to keep them or store "deeper".
- [ ] The frontier file (`.cbf` beside the `.cbt`): `_remaining`,
      `_longestLoss`, both bit sets, the queued entries at plies > N, and the
      en passant nodes. About 3.3 bytes a slot plus queue, so ~1 GB for a
      5-piece table: this is the "more disk space" Matthew mentioned.
      `extend <material> --cap M` loads it and carries on from N+1.
- [ ] Edges (part b): a capture into a smaller table that answers "deeper
      than N" is an **unknown exit**, not a draw. A third bit per slot
      (`_hasUnknownExit`): the position can still be proven a win, but not
      a loss. A child settled at depth d makes the parent d+1, so sub-tables
      capped at N are deep enough for a parent capped at N. On `extend`,
      extend the sub-tables first, then re-probe every slot with the
      unknown-exit bit before carrying on.
- [ ] The test that proves the edges: solve all 36 tables capped at N = 10,
      extend to 20, 40, ... up to uncapped. Each final table must be
      byte-identical to `tables-baseline`. Also a statistics table for
      Matthew: per table, the share settled within 10 / 20 / 40 / all plies.

### Session 3: the 50-move rule (ladder part c)
- [ ] DTZ: distance to the next capture or pawn move (a "zeroing" move),
      capped at 100 plies, which is the 50-move rule. A zeroing move resets
      the count, so its value is only win / draw / loss (how far that win
      is doesn't matter). The cap is exact at every table edge, so the
      "deeper than N" of session 2 turns into the rule's own answer:
      a win needing more than 100 plies is a draw under the rule.
      Count those separately ("cursed wins", "blessed losses") for Matthew.
- [ ] Pawn moves zero too, and they stay inside the table. Solve a pawn
      table in slices by pawn placement, most advanced first. Pawns never
      move back, so each slice only leans on slices already solved. This is
      also the memory fix for 5-piece pawn tables (947 M slots as one piece;
      a slice is 1/48th-ish of that per pawn square).
- [ ] Storage: DTZ as its own table file (`.cbz`?) beside the DTM `.cbt`,
      same index. Or one pass producing both, if memory allows. Check some
      DTZ values against a published source (Syzygy tables are DTZ50) and
      write down which positions were checked.
- [ ] `probe` shows both: mate distance, and whether the win survives the rule.

### Session 4: the first 5-piece tables
- [ ] Run in whichever of WSL / Windows has the headroom (session 1's
      projection). K+Q+R v K first (all wins, short mates). Measure time
      (4-piece pawnless solves take ~12 s for 3.8 M slots; 64x the slots is
      ~15 min if it scales linearly, likely more from cache misses), peak
      memory, and file size (242 M x 2 bytes = 484 MB a table).
- [ ] Then K+R+B v K+R. Check the longest mates against published values
      (look them up; don't trust memory). `verify` a sample stride.
- [ ] Climb the ladder: cap at 100 plies first (session 2), then extend.
      DTZ tables (session 3) for the same material.
- [ ] Disk budget for every pawnless 5-piece table, before starting the lot.
      Ask Matthew before filling the disk.

## Done: milestone 1, the foundation

- [x] 6-bit square code, 48-byte `PackedBoard`, FEN and hex in and out
- [x] Tiered checker: meaningless codes, king count, pawns on back ranks,
      promotion-aware material (bishops by square colour)
- [x] `.cbb` board files: add, import, list, export, check, sort + dedupe
- [x] Exact per-tier counter, cross-checked by brute force and by DP
- [x] C# port of the BinaryPossibility core, plus `SuperposedBoard`
- [x] CLI: `ranges`, `check`, `show`, `sample`, `file …`

## In progress: milestone 2, the minimum-spec endgame tree (thesis core)

The plan: take the smallest game that can actually be won, map its whole
tree, record win/loss, and sort it by favourable outcome. Endgames matter
most, so work **backwards from the end** (retrograde analysis, which is how
endgame tablebases are built) rather than forwards from the start.

- King vs king on its own is always a draw, so there is nothing to rank.
  The smallest sets with real wins are **three pieces**: K+Q v K and K+R v K
  (then K+P v K, the first one with promotion in it).
- 3 pieces × 64 squares × side to move ≈ 500k raw positions, small enough
  to solve completely and hold in memory.

Steps:

- [x] Position = board + side to move, castling rights, en passant, clocks
      (full FEN in and out, make / unmake in place)
- [x] Legal move generator (pseudo-legal moves, then filter out moves that
      leave your own king in check). Matches published perft counts on all
      six standard positions, including start position depth 6
      (119,060,324) and position 6 depth 5 (164,075,551)
- [x] Checkmate / stalemate detection
- [ ] Speed: ~13-16M nodes/s with the 64-square array. Bitboards (and
      magic or PEXT sliding attacks) should give 10x+ when search needs it
- [x] "Un-move" generator for going backwards (pawnless: any piece of the
      side that just moved steps back to an empty square)
- [x] Retrograde solver: mates are losses in 0, then ply by ply outward.
      A move into a lost position makes a win, and every move into a won
      position makes a loss. Captures are looked up in the smaller table they
      lead to (solved on demand)
- [x] Store results **indexed, not as boards**: one 16-bit value per
      index = squares of each piece + side to move. `.cbt` files, saved in
      `./tables` and reused
- [x] Commands: `solve KQvK`, `probe <fen>` (outcome + every move ranked),
      `line <fen>` (best play all the way to mate)
- [x] "Sort the tree by favourable outcome": `RankMoves` orders every move
      fastest win first, then draws, then slowest loss
- [x] Verified: every K+Q v K and K+R v K position equals the best of its
      moves (a unique solution given the mates), and the longest mates match
      the known values: KQvK 10, KRvK 16, KQvKR 35, KBNvK 33, KPvK 28
- [ ] Export the principal tree (not just one line) from a position, to a
      chosen depth, as a file the thesis can use
- [x] Symmetry: 8-fold for pawnless tables (the white king in the a1-d1-d4
      triangle, 462 king pairs), 2-fold with pawns (1,806 pairs); adjacent
      kings left out. KQvKR 64 MB -> 7.2 MB. All 36 tables re-solved
      byte-identical to the old solver's; all 36 in 8 min, 1.9 GB -> 427 MB
- [ ] Tighter still: identical pieces in any order are stored twice (KQQvK,
      KRRvK...: 2x), pawns index 64 squares where 48 are possible (1.33x a
      pawn), and the other pieces still get 64 squares each, holes included
- [ ] The 5-piece tables and the depth ladder: see **"Now: the session
      plan"** at the top. Four sessions, briefs there
- [x] Pawns on one side: pawn pushes and un-moves, promotions into the
      other tables, colour swap with the board flipped. KPvK (28 moves,
      76.5% of white-to-move positions won), KQvKP, KRvKP solved; KPvK
      passes the full consistency check plus textbook positions
- [x] Pawns on both sides, with en passant: a double push that allows en
      passant leads to an extra node worth the better of the table value and
      the capture. `probe` applies the same rule to FENs with an e.p. square
- [x] `verify <material> [stride]`: check a solved table against its moves
- [x] Pawn-table symmetry: mirror a-d / e-h files only (2-fold)
- [ ] The 50-move rule: these tables count distance to mate and ignore it.
      Nothing solved so far comes close (KQvKR's longest is 35), but some
      5-piece wins take more than 50 moves. Add DTZ (distance to a capture or
      pawn move) when that matters. Now session 3 of the session plan
- [ ] Grow the material set: KBBvK, KQvKQ, KRvKB, KRvKN … then 5 pieces
      after symmetry

## Next: storing games (ahead of the 5-piece tables)

A game is its start position plus one byte per move: the move's place in the
position's legal moves, **sorted by from-square, to-square, promotion piece**.
The order is set by the rules, not by the move generator, so the bitboard
rewrite can't silently change what old files mean. No position has more than
218 legal moves, so a byte always fits. Most games start from the standard
position and store no FEN. Going back is replay: position n is the first n
moves played from the start.

1. [x] `.cbg` game files: tags, result, move bytes. PGN import (reader: tags,
       comments, variations, NAGs, SAN parsing) and export; `game import`,
       `export`, `list`, `count`. Round trip: PGN in = PGN out
   - [ ] Tags cost more than the moves (590 KB v 165 KB over 5,000 games): a
         shared string table for tag names and repeated values
   - [ ] Speed: ~3,000 games/s, so a Lichess month (~100M games) would take
         ~9 h. Each move generates and sorts the legal moves twice (SAN in,
         code out); once would do
2. [x] Replay to any ply: `game show <file> <n> [ply]` (negative counts back
       from the end); game n is found by skipping the others' move bytes
3. [ ] Position index (Zobrist hash -> game, ply): from a position, every
       game that reached it, and where each came from and went
4. [ ] Repetition (Matthew's idea): repetition rules remove no *positions*,
       but they make the number of *games* finite (the 75-move and fivefold
       rules cap a game at roughly 8,849 moves). Measure it two ways:
   - [ ] A perft that refuses repeated positions: how much each depth loses
         (expect almost nothing early; the first threefold needs 8 plies)
   - [ ] On stored games, via the position index: every repetition, and
         whether "the same piece making the same move back and forth"
         predicts one (a detector, not the rule: FIDE counts positions)
   - [x] Within one game: `game grade` counts repeats (FIDE's notion of a
         position) and back-and-forth "shuffles" per game
   - [x] Tune the shuffle rule: Matthew chose "only while nothing is
         happening" (10+ plies without a capture or pawn move). Games flagged
         by shuffling alone went from 9,937 to 97; time wasters 14% to 6%
5. [x] Real games: Lichess 2013-01 (121,332) imported, graded (early kill /
       efficient / time waster), and measured as a tree (89% of plies are
       distinct tree nodes, 86% distinct positions; median game new from
       ply 7). 2013-02 added on top: 87.7% new, median new from ply 8, so
       doubling saves ~1.3%.
   - [x] Five months (Jan-May 2013, 741k games): new tree nodes 89.0 ->
         86.6%, median split point ply 7 -> 9. Opening (first 12 plies) new
         39 -> 27%; <= 6-piece positions 93 -> 84% new, 0.3% of games arrive
         somewhere known; <= 4-piece 84 -> 64% new, 6% arrive known
   - [ ] A recent month (tens of millions of games) is the real test of the
         curve, but needs hours to import and several GB for the hash sets.
         A disk-backed or sorted-file version of GameTreeStats first
6. [ ] Later: where each game enters table territory, and whether it played
       perfectly from there (the ranked-move list scores each move); import
       a Lichess database month to see how it scales

## Then: milestone 3, compete (openly, as software)

Always play as a declared engine, only in software competition. The steps
build on each other: each stage has to be solid before the next.

### 3a. A playing engine (in progress)

- [x] Zobrist hashing (incremental, checked against recomputation)
- [x] Search: iterative deepening, alpha-beta / principal variation search,
      transposition table, null-move pruning, late-move reductions, check
      extension, quiescence search on captures, killer and history move
      ordering, mate-distance pruning, repetition and 50-move draws
- [x] Evaluation: material + piece-square tables (Michniewski's simplified
      evaluation), king table blended from middlegame to endgame, bishop pair
- [x] Our own endgame tables as perfect knowledge, probed only if already on
      disk (never solved mid-game). At the root with every reply covered,
      the engine plays the table's move outright
- [x] Time management: per-move budget from clock, increment and moves to go;
      no new depth after half the budget, hard stop at the limit
- [x] **UCI protocol**: `uci`, `isready`, `ucinewgame`, `setoption` (Hash,
      EndgameTables), `position`, `go` (depth, nodes, movetime, wtime/btime,
      winc/binc, movestogo, infinite), `stop`, `quit`, plus `d` and `eval`
- [x] Engine executable `ChessBruteforcer.Engine` with `bench [depth]` (speed)
      and `selfplay [games] [ms]` (robustness: plays itself to the end)
- [x] Tests: mates in 1, free / poisoned material, stalemate, UCI commands,
      movetime, and search mate distances checked against the K+R v K table
- [ ] Solve the remaining 4-piece tables (two pieces v bare king: KQPvK,
      KRPvK, KQQvK, …): `scripts/build-tables.sh` does all 30. Without them the engine may "simplify" into a table it
      has, e.g. give up its queen for a proven K+P v K win, which is correct
      but slow
- [ ] Speed: ~550k nodes/s. Bitboards plus generating only legal moves
      should give several times more
- [ ] Evaluation: pawn structure (passed, doubled, isolated), king safety,
      mobility, tapered values for every piece, then tune from match results
- [ ] Draw knowledge in search: insufficient material
- [ ] Pondering and multiple threads (later)

### 3b. Local matches

Plan change: cutechess isn't installable in the build environment, so
matches here use our own runner (built on `selfplay`). On your own machine,
cutechess-cli or fastchess work with the engine executable as it is.
Stockfish *is* installable, and at reduced strength it makes a good yardstick.

- [x] Match runner (`ChessBruteforcer.Match`): two UCI engines as separate
      processes, openings played in colour-reversed pairs, a real clock
      with time forfeits, every game ending (mate, stalemate, 50-move,
      threefold, insufficient material, illegal / missing move), optional
      adjudication by our tables, several games at once, PGN output
- [x] Elo difference with 95% interval, LOS, and SPRT early stopping
- [x] `scripts/match.sh`: snapshot a build, play it v Stockfish at a set Elo
      or v another snapshot
- [x] Match log: MATCHES.md
- [x] First yardstick: v0.1 beat Stockfish-1500 18-2; v0.2 v Stockfish-2000
      11-9. Roughly 2000 on Stockfish's UCI_Elo scale (wide error bars)
- [x] Time forfeits traced to first-time endgame-table reads from a slow disk
      mid-search; tables now preload on `isready`, plus a Move Overhead option
- [ ] More games per measurement (hundreds, not tens) once changes are small
- [ ] Gauntlet against other open-source engines of known CCRL rating

### 3c. Lichess bot account

- [ ] Create a separate account and upgrade it to a BOT account (permanent,
      labelled as a bot, only plays via the Bot API)
- [ ] Run it with the open-source lichess-bot bridge, which speaks UCI to
      the engine
- [ ] Decide what challenges to accept (time controls, bots only or humans
      too), and a machine to host it
- [ ] Profile page says plainly what it is: engine name, author, that it
      is software

### 3d. Engine rating lists and tournaments

- [ ] Public release: a versioned build plus source or binary, and a
      licence, since rating lists test engines they can download and run
- [ ] Submit to CCRL (and similar lists) once it is stable and doesn't crash
      or lose on time
- [ ] Later: engine tournaments (e.g. TCEC entry is by application once
      an engine is strong enough)

## Later: tighter null-space tiers

Each of these is a necessary condition for a legal position that is still
cheap to check:

- [ ] Kings on adjacent squares (impossible)
- [ ] Side to move cannot capture the enemy king (needs move generation, see above)
- [ ] Promotions need captures: a pawn has to get past the enemy pawn on its
      file, and a pawn that changes file captured something. Bound
      promotions and pawn file changes by the opponent's missing pieces
- [ ] Pawn structure: e.g. doubled pawns need a capture per extra pawn on a file
- [ ] Bishops trapped behind unmoved pawns (e.g. a bishop on c1 with b2 and
      d2 pawns at home cannot have left, and cannot be a promoted piece either)
- [ ] Extend `RangeCounter` to count each new tier exactly, or estimate it by
      sampling when an exact count is out of reach
- [ ] Castling rights and en passant in the spare bit, with their placement
      rules (a rook with rights must be on its corner, the king on e1/e8, an
      en passant pawn on rank 4/5 with empty squares behind it)

## Later: storage at scale

- [ ] External-sort `dedupe` (merge sorted chunks) for files bigger than RAM
- [ ] `file merge a.cbb b.cbb` for sorted-file union
- [ ] Benchmark compression of sorted vs unsorted `.cbb` (zstd, NTFS
      compression)
- [ ] Storing *games*: now its own section, "Next: storing games" above

## Later: superposition

- [ ] Count tier 2+ completions of a partially collapsed `SuperposedBoard`
      (at the moment only tier 1 is counted per square)
- [ ] Weighted superposition over *pieces* rather than bits (e.g. "this
      square is a knight or empty"), which fits the checker far better than
      raw bits
- [ ] Port the rest of PythonBinaryPossibility if it turns out to be useful
      (trees, glitch, entropy tools)
