# TODO / roadmap

If you're asking "where are we?", this is the answer. Top to bottom is
roughly the order of work. Tick items off here and log them in
[WORKLOG.md](WORKLOG.md).

## Done: milestone 1, the foundation

- [x] 6-bit square code, 48-byte `PackedBoard`, FEN and hex in and out
- [x] Tiered checker: meaningless codes, king count, pawns on back ranks,
      promotion-aware material (bishops by square colour)
- [x] `.cbb` board files: add, import, list, export, check, sort + dedupe
- [x] Exact per-tier counter, cross-checked by brute force and by DP
- [x] C# port of the BinaryPossibility core, plus `SuperposedBoard`
- [x] CLI: `ranges`, `check`, `show`, `sample`, `file …`

## In progress: milestone 2, the minimum-spec endgame tree (thesis core)

The plan: take the smallest game that can actually be won, map its whole
tree, record win/loss, and sort it by favourable outcome. Endgames matter
most, so work **backwards from the end** (retrograde analysis, which is how
endgame tablebases are built) rather than forwards from the start.

- King vs king on its own is always a draw, so there is nothing to rank.
  The smallest sets with real wins are **three pieces**: K+Q v K and K+R v K
  (then K+P v K, the first one with promotion in it).
- 3 pieces × 64 squares × side to move ≈ 500k raw positions, small enough
  to solve completely and hold in memory.

Steps:

- [x] Position = board + side to move, castling rights, en passant, clocks
      (full FEN in and out, make / unmake in place)
- [x] Legal move generator (pseudo-legal moves, then filter out moves that
      leave your own king in check). Matches published perft counts on all
      six standard positions, including start position depth 6
      (119,060,324) and position 6 depth 5 (164,075,551)
- [x] Checkmate / stalemate detection
- [ ] Speed: ~13-16M nodes/s with the 64-square array. Bitboards (and
      magic or PEXT sliding attacks) should give 10x+ when search needs it
- [x] "Un-move" generator for going backwards (pawnless: any piece of the
      side that just moved steps back to an empty square)
- [x] Retrograde solver: mates are losses in 0, then ply by ply outward.
      A move into a lost position makes a win, and every move into a won
      position makes a loss. Captures are looked up in the smaller table they
      lead to (solved on demand)
- [x] Store results **indexed, not as boards**: one 16-bit value per
      index = squares of each piece + side to move. `.cbt` files, saved in
      `./tables` and reused
- [x] Commands: `solve KQvK`, `probe <fen>` (outcome + every move ranked),
      `line <fen>` (best play all the way to mate)
- [x] "Sort the tree by favourable outcome": `RankMoves` orders every move
      fastest win first, then draws, then slowest loss
- [x] Verified: every K+Q v K and K+R v K position equals the best of its
      moves (a unique solution given the mates), and the longest mates match
      the known values: KQvK 10, KRvK 16, KQvKR 35, KBNvK 33, KPvK 28
- [ ] Export the principal tree (not just one line) from a position, to a
      chosen depth, as a file the thesis can use
- [ ] Symmetry: 8-fold for pawnless tables (fold the white king into the
      a1-d1-d4 triangle, 10 squares instead of 64), and skip the impossible
      placements the raw index keeps. KQvKR drops from 64 MB to ~5 MB
- [ ] Memory: 4-piece solves peak at ~700 MB and take ~2 minutes; the
      working arrays can shrink (bit arrays, one queue) before 5 pieces
- [x] Pawns on one side: pawn pushes and un-moves, promotions into the
      other tables, colour swap with the board flipped. KPvK (28 moves,
      76.5% of white-to-move positions won), KQvKP, KRvKP solved; KPvK
      passes the full consistency check plus textbook positions
- [x] Pawns on both sides, with en passant: a double push that allows en
      passant leads to an extra node worth the better of the table value and
      the capture. `probe` applies the same rule to FENs with an e.p. square
- [x] `verify <material> [stride]`: check a solved table against its moves
- [ ] Pawn-table symmetry: mirror a-d / e-h files only (2-fold)
- [ ] The 50-move rule: these tables count distance to mate and ignore it.
      Nothing solved so far comes close (KQvKR's longest is 35), but some
      5-piece wins take more than 50 moves. Add DTZ (distance to a capture or
      pawn move) when that matters
- [ ] Grow the material set: KBBvK, KQvKQ, KRvKB, KRvKN … then 5 pieces
      after symmetry

## Then: milestone 3, compete (openly, as software)

Always play as a declared engine, only in software competition. The steps
build on each other: each stage has to be solid before the next.

### 3a. A playing engine (in progress)

- [x] Zobrist hashing (incremental, checked against recomputation)
- [x] Search: iterative deepening, alpha-beta / principal variation search,
      transposition table, null-move pruning, late-move reductions, check
      extension, quiescence search on captures, killer and history move
      ordering, mate-distance pruning, repetition and 50-move draws
- [x] Evaluation: material + piece-square tables (Michniewski's simplified
      evaluation), king table blended from middlegame to endgame, bishop pair
- [x] Our own endgame tables as perfect knowledge, probed only if already on
      disk (never solved mid-game). At the root with every reply covered,
      the engine plays the table's move outright
- [x] Time management: per-move budget from clock, increment and moves to go;
      no new depth after half the budget, hard stop at the limit
- [x] **UCI protocol**: `uci`, `isready`, `ucinewgame`, `setoption` (Hash,
      EndgameTables), `position`, `go` (depth, nodes, movetime, wtime/btime,
      winc/binc, movestogo, infinite), `stop`, `quit`, plus `d` and `eval`
- [x] Engine executable `ChessBruteforcer.Engine` with `bench [depth]` (speed)
      and `selfplay [games] [ms]` (robustness: plays itself to the end)
- [x] Tests: mates in 1, free / poisoned material, stalemate, UCI commands,
      movetime, and search mate distances checked against the K+R v K table
- [ ] Solve the remaining 4-piece tables (two pieces v bare king: KQPvK,
      KRPvK, KQQvK, …): `scripts/build-tables.sh` does all 30. Without them the engine may "simplify" into a table it
      has, e.g. give up its queen for a proven K+P v K win, which is correct
      but slow
- [ ] Speed: ~550k nodes/s. Bitboards plus generating only legal moves
      should give several times more
- [ ] Evaluation: pawn structure (passed, doubled, isolated), king safety,
      mobility, tapered values for every piece, then tune from match results
- [ ] Draw knowledge in search: insufficient material
- [ ] Pondering and multiple threads (later)

### 3b. Local matches

Plan change: cutechess isn't installable in the build environment, so
matches here use our own runner (built on `selfplay`). On your own machine,
cutechess-cli or fastchess work with the engine executable as it is.
Stockfish *is* installable, and at reduced strength it makes a good yardstick.

- [x] Match runner (`ChessBruteforcer.Match`): two UCI engines as separate
      processes, openings played in colour-reversed pairs, a real clock
      with time forfeits, every game ending (mate, stalemate, 50-move,
      threefold, insufficient material, illegal / missing move), optional
      adjudication by our tables, several games at once, PGN output
- [x] Elo difference with 95% interval, LOS, and SPRT early stopping
- [x] `scripts/match.sh`: snapshot a build, play it v Stockfish at a set Elo
      or v another snapshot
- [x] Match log: MATCHES.md
- [x] First yardstick: v0.1 beat Stockfish-1500 18-2; v0.2 v Stockfish-2000
      11-9. Roughly 2000 on Stockfish's UCI_Elo scale (wide error bars)
- [x] Time forfeits traced to first-time endgame-table reads from a slow disk
      mid-search; tables now preload on `isready`, plus a Move Overhead option
- [ ] More games per measurement (hundreds, not tens) once changes are small
- [ ] Gauntlet against other open-source engines of known CCRL rating

### 3c. Lichess bot account

- [ ] Create a separate account and upgrade it to a BOT account (permanent,
      labelled as a bot, only plays via the Bot API)
- [ ] Run it with the open-source lichess-bot bridge, which speaks UCI to
      the engine
- [ ] Decide what challenges to accept (time controls, bots only or humans
      too), and a machine to host it
- [ ] Profile page says plainly what it is: engine name, author, that it
      is software

### 3d. Engine rating lists and tournaments

- [ ] Public release: a versioned build plus source or binary, and a
      licence, since rating lists test engines they can download and run
- [ ] Submit to CCRL (and similar lists) once it is stable and doesn't crash
      or lose on time
- [ ] Later: engine tournaments (e.g. TCEC entry is by application once
      an engine is strong enough)

## Later: tighter null-space tiers

Each of these is a necessary condition for a legal position that is still
cheap to check:

- [ ] Kings on adjacent squares (impossible)
- [ ] Side to move cannot capture the enemy king (needs move generation, see above)
- [ ] Promotions need captures: a pawn has to get past the enemy pawn on its
      file, and a pawn that changes file captured something. Bound
      promotions and pawn file changes by the opponent's missing pieces
- [ ] Pawn structure: e.g. doubled pawns need a capture per extra pawn on a file
- [ ] Bishops trapped behind unmoved pawns (e.g. a bishop on c1 with b2 and
      d2 pawns at home cannot have left, and cannot be a promoted piece either)
- [ ] Extend `RangeCounter` to count each new tier exactly, or estimate it by
      sampling when an exact count is out of reach
- [ ] Castling rights and en passant in the spare bit, with their placement
      rules (a rook with rights must be on its corner, the king on e1/e8, an
      en passant pawn on rank 4/5 with empty squares behind it)

## Later: storage at scale

- [ ] External-sort `dedupe` (merge sorted chunks) for files bigger than RAM
- [ ] `file merge a.cbb b.cbb` for sorted-file union
- [ ] Benchmark compression of sorted vs unsorted `.cbb` (zstd, NTFS
      compression)
- [ ] Storing *games*, not just positions: a start board + move list, or
      chains of board hashes

## Later: superposition

- [ ] Count tier 2+ completions of a partially collapsed `SuperposedBoard`
      (at the moment only tier 1 is counted per square)
- [ ] Weighted superposition over *pieces* rather than bits (e.g. "this
      square is a knight or empty"), which fits the checker far better than
      raw bits
- [ ] Port the rest of PythonBinaryPossibility if it turns out to be useful
      (trees, glitch, entropy tools)
