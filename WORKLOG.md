## 2026-09-26: milestone 1, the foundation

**Decisions**

- 6 bits per square, 48 bytes per board:
  `[occupied][colour][type×3][spare]`. The spare bit is reserved (it must be
  0 for now) and is kept for castling or en passant. 4 bits (32 bytes) would
  fit 13 states, but 6 gives each bit a meaning, which suits the
  superposition work.
- C# / .NET 8, xunit for tests.
- Board files are headerless runs of 48-byte records, so dedupe is sort +
  unique and sorted files compress well.
- The first exact count covers material rules only. King adjacency and the
  rest are on the roadmap.

**Correction to the starting assumption**

"There can never be two queens on one side" isn't true: promotion makes up
to nine possible. The rule the checker uses is that promoted pieces needed ≤
missing pawns, with bishops counted by square colour. Getting this right
changes the tier 4 count by about 7 × 10⁸.

**Results**

- Exact survivors: 2³⁸⁴ → 13⁶⁴ ≈ 2.0e71 → 1.5e68 → 6.7e66 → **1.44e49**.
- The counter is checked against brute force (2×3 and 3×2 boards) and
  square-by-square DP (4×4, 3×5). They agree at every tier.
- `sample`: none of 20,000 raw collapses has a meaningful code on every
  square, and about 0.07% of meaningful-code collapses have the right kings.
  Both match the counted ratios.

**Direction (thesis)**

Map the minimum-spec game and its win/loss tree, then sort it by favourable
outcome, working backwards from the endgame. King vs king is a dead draw, so
the first real target is K+Q v K / K+R v K via retrograde analysis. It's
milestone 2 in TODO.md.

**Competition plan**

The engine will only ever play openly as software: local engine-vs-engine
matches first, then a labelled Lichess BOT account, then engine rating lists
(CCRL) and tournaments. Added as milestone 3 in TODO.md, together with the
UCI protocol it needs. Solved endgames will be stored as indexed outcomes
rather than 48-byte boards, because that is the storage that scales.

## 2026-09-26: move generator

- `Position` (full FEN, make / unmake in place, check / mate / stalemate),
  `Move` (UCI notation), `MoveGenerator` (pseudo-legal, then filtered for
  own-king safety), `Perft`.
- Perft matches the published counts on all six standard positions:
  start 1-6, Kiwipete 1-4, position 3 1-6, position 4 1-5, position 5 1-4,
  position 6 1-5. Unit tests cover the shallower depths plus castling rules,
  en passant pins, promotions, and mate vs stalemate.
- One scare on the way: position 6 came out 44 moves instead of 46. It turned
  out the FEN had been typed from memory wrong (a white pawn on a2 instead of
  a3). With the right FEN it matches to depth 5.
- Speed is about 13-16M nodes/s in release with a plain 64-square array. That
  is plenty for 3-4 piece endgames; bitboards come later, for search.
- Next: the retrograde solver for K+Q v K.

## 2026-09-26: endgame solver (milestone 2 core)

- `Endgame/`: `Material` (signatures like KQvKR, stronger side as white),
  `Outcome` (win / loss / draw with distance to mate in plies),
  `EndgameTable` (index, retrograde solve, save / load as `.cbt`),
  `Tablebase` (finds or solves tables, colour swap, ranks moves, best line).
- Retrograde method: seed mates as Loss(0) and stalemates as draws, then
  process ply buckets in order. Losses make their predecessors wins;
  wins count down each predecessor's remaining moves, and a predecessor with
  none left (and no drawing capture) becomes a loss. Captures are settled up
  front by probing the smaller table. Predecessors come from pawnless
  un-moves.
- Results match the known longest mates: KQvK 10, KRvK 16, KQvKR 35,
  KBNvK 33. KvK has 3,612 legal placements, which agrees with the range
  counter's non-adjacent-kings figure.
- Test: every legal KQvK / KRvK position equals the best outcome over its
  moves, which with the mates fixed determines the table uniquely.
- Three of my hand-picked test positions were wrong (a defended queen that
  was really loose, and so on); the solver was right each time.
- Cost: 3-piece tables ~2 s and 1 MB; 4-piece ~110 s, 64 MB on disk, ~700 MB
  peak memory. Symmetry and a tighter index are next before 5 pieces.
- DTM ignores the 50-move rule. That's fine so far, noted in TODO for 5 pieces.

## 2026-09-26: pawns in the endgame solver

- Pawn pushes stay in a table, while promotions (like captures) go to the table
  for the promoted piece. Pawn un-moves: one square back, or two back to its
  starting rank. Pawns on rank 1 or 8 are impossible slots.
- `SwapColours` now also flips the board (square ^ 56), so a black pawn
  side is looked up in the white-pawn table with pawns running the right
  way. Pawnless results are unchanged by the flip.
- KPvK: 28-move longest mate, 76.5% of white-to-move positions won. Both
  match the figures I remember for this endgame, though I'm less sure of the
  source than for KQK / KRK. The real proof is the consistency test over
  every legal KPvK position, plus textbook positions (square rule, rook pawn
  in the corner, king on the 6th in front of its pawn, an unstoppable black
  pawn through the colour swap).
- KQvKP ~7.5 min and KRvKP ~4 min, each including the four 4-piece tables
  their promotions need (KQvKQ, KQvKR, …).
- Pawns on both sides are refused for now: en passant makes the value
  depend on the previous move, and the index doesn't record that. The plan
  is in TODO.

## 2026-09-26: en passant, pawns on both sides

- Tables keep storing positions without en passant rights. A double push
  that hands the opponent an e.p. capture leads to an extra node: the value
  is the better of the table entry and the capture for the side that may
  take, or the capture alone if it is the only legal move. `Probe` applies
  the same rule to FENs with an e.p. square, through separate code.
- New `verify <material> [stride]` command: every legal position must equal
  the best outcome over its moves.
- KPvKP: solved in ~5 min (given the promotion tables). **All 14,872,176
  legal positions verified consistent**, which cross-checks the solver's e.p.
  nodes against `Probe`'s e.p. rule. White-to-move and black-to-move
  statistics are identical, as the colour-swap-and-flip symmetry says they
  must be.
- E.p. matters: with white Pe5 v black Pd5, white to move wins in 11 with the
  e.p. right and in 12 without.
- Plan change: a slow opt-in test (`CHESS_SLOW_TESTS=<tables dir>`) samples
  KPvKP, because building its tables takes ~20 minutes, too long for every
  run.
- Every 4-piece table (21 of them) now exists in the scratch tables directory.
  They are generated data, so not committed.

## 2026-09-26: the engine (milestone 3a)

- Zobrist hashing on `Position` (incremental; "no castling rights" hashes
  to 0 so boards built square by square match FEN ones, a mismatch the
  tests caught). Null move for the search.
- `Engine/`: `Evaluation` (material + simplified piece-square tables, tapered
  king, bishop pair), `TranspositionTable`, `Search` (ID, PVS, TT, null move,
  LMR, check extension, quiescence, killers / history, repetition and
  50-move draws, mate-distance pruning, endgame-table probing), `UciEngine`.
- New executable `ChessBruteforcer.Engine`: UCI by default, plus `bench` and
  `selfplay`. Bench depth 7 over 6 positions: ~0.94M nodes, ~560k nodes/s.
- Tests: hashing (random playouts, transpositions, null move), colour-blind
  evaluation, mates in one, free and poisoned material, stalemate,
  repetition avoidance, node limit, UCI commands and movetime. Also the
  search's mate-in-2 / mate-in-3 distances match the K+R v K table on
  positions drawn from it.
- Self-play at 100 ms / move: 4 games, 2 draws by repetition and 2 mates, no
  illegal moves. One "blunder" (black Qd7-f7, queen taken) turned out to be
  deliberate: with the tables loaded, K+P v K after the capture is a proven
  mate in 12, while with the queen on the search couldn't prove any mate.
  Correct but slow; solving K+Q+P v K and the other 2-v-0 tables fixes it.
- Plan change: cutechess isn't installable here, so local matches will use
  our own runner. Stockfish is installable as a yardstick opponent.

## 2026-09-27: match runner (milestone 3b)

- `Match/`: `San` (standard notation incl. disambiguation, e.p., promotion,
  check / mate), `GameRecord` (PGN), `IPlayer` / `UciPlayer` (engines as
  separate processes), `GamePlayer` (clock, time forfeits, every game ending,
  table adjudication), `MatchStats` (Elo + 95% interval, LOS, SPRT),
  `MatchRunner` (colour-reversed opening pairs, concurrency).
- New executable `ChessBruteforcer.Match` and `scripts/match.sh`. Stockfish 16
  installed from apt as the yardstick (UCI_Elo 1320-3190).
- Results (MATCHES.md): v0.1 18-2 v Stockfish-1500; v0.2 11-9 and v0.3 14-4-2
  v Stockfish-2000. About 2100 on Stockfish's scale, approximate.
- Two time forfeits, traced to first-time endgame-table reads mid-search on a
  slow disk (~65 MB/s). Fix: tables load into memory on `isready`
  (`Tablebase.Preload`, `LoadOnDemand = false`), plus a Move Overhead UCI
  option. v0.3 had no forfeits. Time losses now report the milliseconds.
- Tests: SAN cases (two of my own test positions were wrong again: a rook
  blocked by its own king, a queen that gave no check), PGN, Elo / SPRT maths,
  time-control parsing, and scripted-player games for mate, illegal move,
  time forfeit, threefold, bare kings, openings.

## 2026-09-27: ready to move to a desktop

- `scripts/build-tables.sh` solves all 30 four-piece tables (15 one-v-one, 15
  two-v-bare-king) into ./tables, skipping ones already there, so it can be
  stopped and restarted. Tested here: KQQvK and KQRvK each took ~107 s.
- Table saves write to a temporary file and rename it, so killing a solve
  never leaves a truncated table.
- What lives only in a cloud session and has to be rebuilt on a new machine:
  the .NET 8 SDK, Stockfish, ./tables (run the script), and engines/
  snapshots (scripts/match.sh snapshot).
