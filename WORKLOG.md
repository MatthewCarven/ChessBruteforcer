## 2026-09-26: milestone 1, the foundation

**Decisions**

- 6 bits per square, 48 bytes per board:
  `[occupied][colour][type×3][spare]`. The spare bit is reserved (it must be
  0 for now) and is kept for castling or en passant. 4 bits (32 bytes) would
  fit 13 states, but 6 gives each bit a meaning, which suits the
  superposition work.
- C# / .NET 8, xunit for tests.
- Board files are headerless runs of 48-byte records, so dedupe is sort +
  unique and sorted files compress well.
- The first exact count covers material rules only. King adjacency and the
  rest are on the roadmap.

**Correction to the starting assumption**

"There can never be two queens on one side" isn't true: promotion makes up
to nine possible. The rule the checker uses is that promoted pieces needed ≤
missing pawns, with bishops counted by square colour. Getting this right
changes the tier 4 count by about 7 × 10⁸.

**Results**

- Exact survivors: 2³⁸⁴ → 13⁶⁴ ≈ 2.0e71 → 1.5e68 → 6.7e66 → **1.44e49**.
- The counter is checked against brute force (2×3 and 3×2 boards) and
  square-by-square DP (4×4, 3×5). They agree at every tier.
- `sample`: none of 20,000 raw collapses has a meaningful code on every
  square, and about 0.07% of meaningful-code collapses have the right kings.
  Both match the counted ratios.

**Direction (thesis)**

Map the minimum-spec game and its win/loss tree, then sort it by favourable
outcome, working backwards from the endgame. King vs king is a dead draw, so
the first real target is K+Q v K / K+R v K via retrograde analysis. It's
milestone 2 in TODO.md.

**Competition plan**

The engine will only ever play openly as software: local engine-vs-engine
matches first, then a labelled Lichess BOT account, then engine rating lists
(CCRL) and tournaments. Added as milestone 3 in TODO.md, together with the
UCI protocol it needs. Solved endgames will be stored as indexed outcomes
rather than 48-byte boards, because that is the storage that scales.

## 2026-09-26: move generator

- `Position` (full FEN, make / unmake in place, check / mate / stalemate),
  `Move` (UCI notation), `MoveGenerator` (pseudo-legal, then filtered for
  own-king safety), `Perft`.
- Perft matches the published counts on all six standard positions:
  start 1-6, Kiwipete 1-4, position 3 1-6, position 4 1-5, position 5 1-4,
  position 6 1-5. Unit tests cover the shallower depths plus castling rules,
  en passant pins, promotions, and mate vs stalemate.
- One scare on the way: position 6 came out 44 moves instead of 46. It turned
  out the FEN had been typed from memory wrong (a white pawn on a2 instead of
  a3). With the right FEN it matches to depth 5.
- Speed is about 13-16M nodes/s in release with a plain 64-square array. That
  is plenty for 3-4 piece endgames; bitboards come later, for search.
- Next: the retrograde solver for K+Q v K.

## 2026-09-26: endgame solver (milestone 2 core)

- `Endgame/`: `Material` (signatures like KQvKR, stronger side as white),
  `Outcome` (win / loss / draw with distance to mate in plies),
  `EndgameTable` (index, retrograde solve, save / load as `.cbt`),
  `Tablebase` (finds or solves tables, colour swap, ranks moves, best line).
- Retrograde method: seed mates as Loss(0) and stalemates as draws, then
  process ply buckets in order. Losses make their predecessors wins;
  wins count down each predecessor's remaining moves, and a predecessor with
  none left (and no drawing capture) becomes a loss. Captures are settled up
  front by probing the smaller table. Predecessors come from pawnless
  un-moves.
- Results match the known longest mates: KQvK 10, KRvK 16, KQvKR 35,
  KBNvK 33. KvK has 3,612 legal placements, which agrees with the range
  counter's non-adjacent-kings figure.
- Test: every legal KQvK / KRvK position equals the best outcome over its
  moves, which with the mates fixed determines the table uniquely.
- Three of my hand-picked test positions were wrong (a defended queen that
  was really loose, and so on); the solver was right each time.
- Cost: 3-piece tables ~2 s and 1 MB; 4-piece ~110 s, 64 MB on disk, ~700 MB
  peak memory. Symmetry and a tighter index are next before 5 pieces.
- DTM ignores the 50-move rule. That's fine so far, noted in TODO for 5 pieces.
